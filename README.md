# watchandnotify

watchandnotify is a script that can be configured to find your favorite watches on [r/watchexchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/). 

I'm a fan of [Brew Watches](https://www.brew-watches.com/) and always had a hard time finding them as they often sell out soon after release or are picked up rather quickly on the second-hand market (e.g. r/watchexchange). 

I created this program to search r/watchexchange periodically to see if a watch brand or model that I'm looking for has been posted for sale. An email with a link to the post will then be sent to me, ensuring I never miss an opportunity to pick up a watch I've been searching for!
